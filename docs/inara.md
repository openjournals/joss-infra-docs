# Inara

Inara is a software package designed to create publishing artifacts for Open Journals submissions. It uses Pandoc and custom templates to generate PDF, HTML, JATS, and Crossref XML files.

Inara is used in the JOSS reviews through a Docker image run by [a custom GitHub action](./github-actions.md#publishing-artifacts).

## Source code

The source code is available at https://github.com/openjournals/inara

The different journals currently supported have a folder inside the [resources directoy](https://github.com/openjournals/inara/tree/main/resources).
